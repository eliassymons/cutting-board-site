        <h4>who we are</h4>
        <p>
          My interest in woodworking began over 20 years ago from the need for a
          simple bookcase. And while that first effort was succcessful, it
          sparked a desire learn more about woodworking tools and techniques.
          Guided by teachers at a local wood working supply store, Woodcraft of
          Dallas, and later at Homestead Heritage School of Woodworking, I took
          classes that helped me expand my skills and knowledge.

          Today I produce a wide variety of wood products, including tables,
          desks, bookcases, jewelry boxes, presentation wine boxes, and many
          more. I use only renewable (non-endangered species) woods, both
          domestic and tropical, to produce heirloom quality furniture. While
          cheap furniture can be found in many stores, such items will last only
          a few years; my furniture will last for generations, provided that it
          is cared for properly.
